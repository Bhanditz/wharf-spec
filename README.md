# The wharf protocol specification

Good specifications are easy to read, practical guidelines that make it easier
for software to be interoperable. This book aims to be a good specification.

Its intended audience includes:

  * People who want to understand the tenets of itch.io's software delivery system,
  to judge its worth / audit it.
  * People who want to write their own implementation of the protocol in another language / for another platform (for example: 1-click Export for a game engine)
  * People who want to use itch.io's implementation of wharf, but with their own backend.
